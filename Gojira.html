    <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>

    <p><strong>Gojira</strong> are a French heavy metal band from Bayonne. Originally formed as <strong>Godzilla</strong>
        in 1996,they changed their name to Gojira in 2001. The band's lineup, consisting of brothers Joe Duplantier (lead vocals, guitar) and Mario
        Duplantier (drums, backing vocals), guitarist Christian Andreu, and bassist Jean-Michel Labadie, has been the
        same since the band's name change.

        They have released six studio albums and three live DVDs. They are known for their environment-themed lyrics and
        have gone from "utmost obscurity" to being placed "amongst (death metal)'s leading new millennium upstarts".[1]
        Gojira have received Grammy nominations for Best Rock Album for their latest album Magma (2016) and Best Metal
        Performance for their single "Silvera".[2]</p>

        <h1>History</h1>
        <hr>
        <h2>Early years and Terra Incognita (1996−2002)</h2>
        <p>Gojira was formed in 1996 by Joe and Mario Duplantier, Christian Andreu, and Alexandre Cornillon in their
            hometown of Ondres. Cornillon left the band in January 1998, and was replaced by Jean-Michel Labadie.[3]
            Gojira's music combines elements of death metal, groove metal, thrash metal, and progressive metal. The band
            started touring and recording under the name Godzilla and released their demos Victim, Possessed, Saturate,
            and Wisdom Comes in 1996, 1997, 1999, and 2000, respectively. After touring, supporting Cannibal Corpse,
            Edge of Sanity, Impaled Nazarene, and Immortal in September 1999,[4] legal problems forced Godzilla to
            change their name. They changed their name to Gojira, the rōmaji spelling of the fictional monster
            Godzilla.[5] Their debut album Terra Incognita was released under the new name in 2001.</p>

            <h2>The Link and From Mars to Sirius (2003−2007)</h2>
            <p>The band released their second studio album, The Link, in 2003; it was reissued in 2007 with remastered
                audio and new booklet artwork.[6] After the success of the first two albums and their live performances,
                they made a DVD in Bordeaux produced by Gabriel Editions. Since 19 May 2004, The Link Alive has been on
                sale in France.[4] In 2005, Gojira decided to sign with French-based Listenable Records to help give
                them exposure outside France with the album From Mars to Sirius.[7]

                Gojira were included in Children of Bodom's US tour in late 2006, joining Amon Amarth and Sanctity as
                the openers.[8] Gojira also supported Trivium on the UK dates of their European tour in 2007 with
                Sanctity and Annihilator.[9] Later they supported Lamb of God on their 2007 American tour along with
                Trivium and Machine Head.[10] In late 2007, they took part in the Radio Rebellion Tour, featuring
                co-headliners Behemoth, Job for a Cowboy, and Beneath the Massacre.[11] In October 2007, Listenable
                Records re-released Gojira's 1997 demo Possessed as a limited edition.[12]</p>

                <h2>The Way of All Flesh (2008−2011)</h2>
                <p>The Way of All Flesh was released on 13 October in Europe via Listenable Records and 14 October in
                    North America through Prosthetic Records in 2008.[13] On 25 July 2008, the band announced the track
                    listing and revealed the final cover art for the record.[14] Joe Duplantier stated about the
                    album, "This record is a lot darker—like, a lot darker, I would say. The music is darker and more violent."
                    [15] Duplantier stated the album will be "more intense, more brutal, and more melodic" than its
                    predecessor.[16] "That's the theme—it's about death itself," he
                    explained. "It's also about the immortality of the soul. That's the main subject for us" .[15] Randy
                    Blythe from the American band Lamb of God appeared as a guest vocalist on the
                    song "Adoration for None" [17] The album took four months to write and record, and three months to
                    mix.[18] On 17 March 2009, the band's first North American headlining tour was announced. The
                    opening bands were The Chariot and Car Bomb.[19] Gojira accompanied Metallica on their tour from 14
                    September to 18 October,[20] performing before Lamb of God. Gojira entered a studio in Los Angeles,
                    California, in early November 2010 with producer Logan Mader to begin recording a new non-profit
                    four-song EP, the proceeds from which will benefit Sea Shepherd, an anti-whaling organization.[21]
                    According to Joe Duplantier, the EP was going to feature guest appearances from the international
                    metal scene.[22] "Of Blood And Salt" features Devin Townsend as a guest vocalist and a guest guitar
                    solo performed by Fredrik Thordendal. The other tracks feature Randy Blythe, Anders Fridén, Jonas
                    Renkse, and Max Cavalera. As a preview of the Sea Shepherd EP, Gojira released "Of Blood And Salt"
                    in May 2011, but the EP has yet to see a release, as the hard drive which held the recordings
                    crashed.[23]</p>


                    <h2>L'Enfant Sauvage (2012−2015)</h2>
                    <p>Gojira were acquired by Roadrunner Records[24] and released L'Enfant Sauvage on 26 June 2012 on
                        that label. The title translates to "The Wild Child". Joe Duplantier explained that titling the
                        album in English inadequately encapsulated the meaning of the French term: "'Sauvage' is
                        something that is not educated or something that is like free and completely free in nature. A
                        wild flower that goes wherever she wants and becomes something beautiful. The idea with
                        "L'Enfant Sauvage" is like with a human that would grow up in nature, raised by wolves, for
                        example, without the influence from others and the influence from institutions or society in
                        general."[25]

                        The title song "L'Enfant Sauvage" was released as a single on 27 April 2012, along with a video
                        to support it.[26] It was followed by a release of the song "Liquid Fire" as a free download on
                        Gojira's official website. On 11 March 2014, Gojira released a Live CD/DVD/Picture book Les
                        Enfants Sauvages, which was recorded at Brixton Academy London in March 2013.[27]

                        In November 2014, the band began constructing a recording studio in Queens, New York City. That
                        same month, Mario Duplantier moved to New York.[28]</p>

                        <h2>Magma (2015−present)</h2>
                        <p>In an interview conducted in February 2015 with AMH TV, Mario Duplantier stated that the band
                            was working on a new album. Further speaking with AMH TV, he went on to say that "[w]e spent
                            two months...composing new stuff, composing new songs. And we feel very optimistic about the
                            future. We're already enjoying a lot of the new stuff. We want to make the strongest album
                            we can do. I mean, all the bands say they try to make the strongest album, but this time, I
                            think we will really do it."[29]


                            The death of Joe's (pictured) and Mario Duplantier's mother greatly affected Magma's
                            recording process.
                            In April 2015, the band finished the construction of their New York recording studio, Silver
                            Cord Studio. However, ten days into recording there, Joe and Mario Duplantier learned that
                            their mother had fallen ill, so the band put the recording session on hold. Their mother
                            later died, which had a profound influence on the recording process.[28][30]

                            On 4 January 2016, the band posted a video on their YouTube page announcing the new album
                            would be out in spring.[31] That same month, Rolling Stone named the album their sixth-most
                            anticipated album of 2016.[32] On 13 April 2016, the band released a thirty-second video
                            teaser confirming that the album will be titled Magma and would be released 17 June 2016
                            through Roadrunner Records.[33] They followed this with the release of the first song from
                            Magma, titled "Stranded", on 22 April.[34] The single's music video was directed by Vincent
                            Caldoni.[34] On 20 May 2016, a second song, "Silvera", was released, accompanied by a music
                            video directed by Drew Cox.[35]

                            Magma was officially released through Roadrunner Records to a generally favorable critical
                            reception, scoring a 79 on Metacritic.[36] The album marked a change in style for the band,
                            with Joe Duplantier experimenting with clean vocals, and with Mario commenting that "this
                            time, we just felt all together that we wanted something straight to the point more. We
                            wanted to change the dynamic."[37] The band toured North America with Tesseract from
                            mid-July through October 2016 in support of the album.[38] In 2016, the band toured the
                            United Kingdom with Alter Bridge, Volbeat, and Like a Storm.[39]

                            Gojira were nominated for two Grammy awards in 2016.[40] Magma was nominated for Best Rock
                            Album, and its second single "Silvera" was nominated for Best Metal Performance.[2]

                            The band played as a supporting act on Metallica's U.S. WorldWired Tour in summer 2017,
                            along with Avenged Sevenfold and Volbeat.[41] Gojira did a United States headliner
                            throughout the fall of 2017, Converge, Code Orange, Pallbearer, Oni and Torche supported
                            them on selected dates.[42]

                            In the summer of 2019, Gojira toured the United States to support Slipknot on their Knotfest
                            Roadshow Tour. Behemoth and Volbeat joined in as supporting acts.[43]

                            On 5 August 2020, the band released a new single called "Another World", their first single
                            in four years.[44] It became their first Billboard-charting song, debuting at number 12 on
                            Hard Rock Digital Song Sales and at number 25 on the Hot Hard Rock Songs chart.[45]</p>
